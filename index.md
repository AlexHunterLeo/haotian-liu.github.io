I'm Fan (Vincent) Mo, a PhD Candidate in [Dyson School of Design Engineering](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/) at [Imperial College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London), supervised by [Dr. Hamed Haddadi](https://haddadi.github.io/). Before starting my PhD, I got my Master of Science in Management and Bachelor of Industrial Engineering at Chongqing University, closely working with [Prof. Jia Zhou](http://www.msre.cqu.edu.cn/info/1145/5364.htm).

My current research focuses on guaranteeing data privacy in IoT, especially in edge computing, helping users train their machine learning models without leakage of their private information, leveraging techniques such Trusted Execution Environments. My previous research focuses on human behavior on wearable/mobile devices and social network sites. I have many experiences in User Study, Usability Evaluation and Test, Experiment Design, UX/UI design, Prototype Develop and Evaluation, Application Development, etc. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields and enjoy beautiful things in both science and humanities.
