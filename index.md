I'm Fan (Vincent) Mo, a PhD candidate in [Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (SysAL)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/systems-algorithms-design-lab/), [Dyson School of Design Engineering](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/) at [Imperial College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London), supervised by [Prof. Hamed Haddadi](https://haddadi.github.io/). I have worked as Interns in [Arm Research - Security and Systems](https://www.arm.com/resources/research) at Cambridge and [Telefónica Research](https://www.telefonica.com/en/sustainability-innovation/innovation/telefonica-research/) at Spain. Previously, I got a Master of Science in Management and a Bachelor of Industrial Engineering in China, supervised by [Prof. Jia Zhou](http://www.msre.cqu.edu.cn/info/1193/5393.htm), working at Human-computer Interaction Lab.

My current research focuses on data privacy and trustworthiness in machine learning at the edge, helping users train their machine learning models without leakage of their private information, leveraging techniques such as Trusted Execution Environments. My previous research focuses on human behavior on wearable/mobile devices and social network sites. I have many experiences in User Study, Usability Evaluation and Test, UX/UI design, Prototype Develop and Evaluation, etc. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields and love beautiful things in both science and humanities.
