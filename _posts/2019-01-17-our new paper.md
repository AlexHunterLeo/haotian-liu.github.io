title: C-shaped tapping pattern on smartwatches' screen you even don't realize
---

News! our new journal paper *"Adapting smart watch interfaces to hand gestures during movements: Offset models and the C-shaped pattern of tapping"* was submitted to a Top journal **Human Factors**.

No matter how smartwatch users move, they have the similar high-accurate tapping areas on the round screen, the **C-shaped**. This is a very special tapping pattern compared to unromantic tapping vector fields on smartphones. It lets us recall the legendary "F-shaped" heat map of visual tracking on websites, which greatly influences the website design guidelines from [Nielsen Normal Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered/).

What we are reminded is, shapes, sizes, and movement conditions, all the stuff are going to impact the hand gesture. What we are facing, is not just simply the "Fig Finger" problem!
