title: C-shaped tapping pattern on smartwatches' screen you even don't realize
---

News! our journal paper *"Adapting smart watch interfaces to hand gestures during movements: Offset models and the C-shaped pattern of tapping"* has been accepted to the journal **Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing** ([Paper](http://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02545-3)). The corresponding patent is published with No: 201810149684X (Chinese version).

No matter how smartwatch users move, they have the similar high-accurate tapping areas on the round screen, a **C-shaped** tapping. This is a very special tapping pattern compared to unromantic tapping vector fields on smartphones. It let us recall the legendary "F-shaped" heat map of visual tracking on websites, which greatly influences the website design guidelines from [Nielsen Normal Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered/).

What we are reminded is, shapes, sizes, and movement conditions, all have impact on the hand gesture. What we are facing is not the simple "Fig Finger" problem.
